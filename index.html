 <h1> {Fusion Exercise 1} <br>
   <h2> This is my first-time using Autodesk Fusion and I have to say it’s very interesting
      and I found it fun exploring the tools in order to make the stamp. Doing this for the first time,
      I followed the tutorial and had no troubles except I didn’t know how to flip the svg file in Autodesk
       and was planning to go back to fix it, but I ran into more problems since I didn’t understand how to
        edit it so I ended up redoing the whole thing once I figured it out. Overall, it was great and, in the
         future, I will learn how to edit my work after its finished without problems hopefully. </h2>
