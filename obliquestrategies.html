 <h1>Part 2 </h1> <br>

<h2> The first two quotes relate to our creative process that we practice and identify with as every artist has their own unique approach to art and how they find motivation or what gets them into art. The third quote is a process that we don't follow but we find interesting. </h2>

<h1> “The comfort zone is a great enemy to creativity.” -Dan Stevens </h1>

<h2> The reason I chose this quote is because I feel like this is where I am most of the time and is the reason I am often in a stump. Because I rather play games in my spare time rather than work on improving my art skills, my art skills stay constant rather than improving. </h2>

<h1> I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious. –Albert Einstein </h1>

<h2> Art is not something I started out because I wanted to make art. It started because I was put in an art class in high school and I would laugh with my friends about how bad my art was and over time that changed to I want to see where this can lead me. </h2>


<h1> Solitude is creativity’s best friend, and solitude is refreshment for our souls. – Naomi Judd </h1>

<h2> I think that this is something I want to explore more because being with others makes me want to play around more than anything so if I was left alone, would I feel more inclined to improve? Or would I just play around just as much or even more? The reason I chose this quote is because I think it could be what I need as some people work better in certain environments and I think this may be the one I need to put myself in. </h2>
